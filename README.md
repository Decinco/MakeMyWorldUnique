# MiniWorld2

MiniWorld2 is a Minecraft (Paper) utility plugin for easily creating temporary instances of Minecraft worlds!
The intended use case for MiniWorld2 is for mini-games, instanced dungeons, or other applications where
a small temporary world is ideal.

The original MiniWorld plugin was created by [TheKDub](https://github.com/thekdub). Originally I was going to simply
update the old code, but at this point it seems it would be easier to simply re-write it as a whole, as the old code
was very messy and to be honest I *hate* migrating legacy code.

## Supported Versions:
- Paper 1.19.4

MiniWorld2 may function with additional versions of Minecraft, however this is untested and not guaranteed.

## Todo:
- [ ] Add Multiverse integration
